                We know that during COVID-19, a lot of folks around the city and state are feeling uneasy about the
                future - we’re not sure what the future holds either.
              </p>
              <p>
                That said: we know that we love making sure you have the gear you need for your adventures, and we’re
                going to keep doing that - with our team - until the city tells us we can’t.
              </p>
              <p>
                But as long as folks like yourself support small businesses around the city, then we’ll be here — every
                day, making sure your orders arrive on time.
              </p>
